        <p>My name is Zakyla Petrie, and I am a final-year Computer Science major with a strong passion for technology
             and problem-solving. My hobbies include reading and photography, which allow me to explore creativity and 
             storytelling from different perspectives. I am particularly interested in web development 
             because it offers a balance between technical skills and creativity, enabling me to build interactive and 
             meaningful experiences for users. I am drawn to the idea of crafting solutions that are not only functional 
             but also accessible and visually engaging,and I see web development as a way to combine my love 
             for design, logic, and innovation.</p>
